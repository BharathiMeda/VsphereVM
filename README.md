# Terraform vSphere VM Creation & Ansible Domain Join

## Description
This project automates the creation of virtual machines (VMs) in a VMware environment using Terraform and configures these VMs to join a domain using an Ansible playbook with realm as a SSSD wrapper. It supports both Windows and Linux VMs. Additionally, a Jenkinsfile is included for automating the process of cloning this repository and executing the Terraform and Ansible scripts.

## Demo
![terraform-jenkins](https://github.com/techmatlock/terraform-jenkins-vsphere-vm/assets/2618095/a3e302ea-0471-40c9-bacd-55790cd1de13)

## Prerequisites
* Terraform <= v1.6.1
* Ansible <= 2.15.6
* VMware vSphere environment <= 8.0.1.00000
* Jenkins with these plugins: Active Choices, Git

## Installation
Fork this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/techmatlock/terraform-jenkins-vsphere-vm.git
```

1. Create a new Jenkins job
2. Give your job a name and choose "Pipeline"
3. Paste the Jenkinsfile contents into the Script section located below Pipeline.

## Usage
You need three credentials set up in Jenkins and their ID's added to the Jenkinsfile.

The Ansible playbook assumes you've already encrypt your files to hide sensitive variables.

I only encrypt the file vault file in the path below:
* Ansible/group_vars/all/vault
